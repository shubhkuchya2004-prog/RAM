#The task is to develop a simple synchronous RAM module using Verilog HDL that supports:

Write operation (data stored into memory)

Read operation (data retrieved from memory)

The RAM must be synchronous, meaning all memory operations occur on the rising edge of the clock. The module should have:

An address input

Data input (for writing)

Data output (for reading)

Read/Write control signal

Clock input

This RAM acts as a small memory block useful in CPUs, microcontrollers, and digital systems.
